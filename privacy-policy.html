      <span>2. Identifying Purposes</span>

      We collect, use and disclose Personal Information to provide you with the
      product or service you have requested and to offer you additional products
      and services we believe you might be interested in. The purposes for which
      we collect Personal Information will be identified before or at the time
      we collect the information. In certain circumstances, the purposes for
      which information is collected may be clear, and consent may be implied,
      such as where your name, address and payment information is provided as
      part of the order process.

      <span>3. Consent</span>

      Knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use or disclosure
      of Personal Information except where required or permitted by law.
      Providing us with your Personal Information is always your choice.
      However, your decision not to provide certain information may limit our
      ability to provide you with our products or services. We will not require
      you to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of information as a
      condition to the supply of a product or service, except as required to be
      able to supply the product or service.

      <span>4. Limiting Collection</span>

      The Personal Information collected will be limited to those details
      necessary for the purposes identified by us. With your consent, we may
      collect Personal Information from you in person, over the telephone or by
      corresponding with you via mail, facsimile, or the Internet.

      <span>5. Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</span>

      Personal Information may only be used or disclosed for the purpose for
      which it was collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when it is
      required or permitted by law. Personal Information will only be retained
      for the period of time required to fulfill the purpose for which we
      collected it or as may be required by law. [If applicable, include a
      description of any parties with whom you may share Personal Information.]

      <span>6. Accuracy</span>

      Personal Information will be maintained in as accurate, complete and
      up-to-date form as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is to
      be used.

      <span>7. Safeguarding Customer Information</span>

      Personal Information will be protected by security safeguards that are
      appropriate to the sensitivity level of the information. We take all
      reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information from any loss
      or unauthorized use, access or disclosure.
